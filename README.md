## Introduction

The main goal of this talk is to introduce you to some of the latest NVIDIA technologies that I believe are most valuable for those learning CUDA & HPC. Given the limited time, we'll focus on providing a broad overview, so it's perfectly fine if you only take away a few key concepts.

See [j3soon/hpc-notes](https://github.com/j3soon/hpc-notes/blob/master/nvidia-resources.md) for more references.
